    <p>Hello! My name is Rajavi Mhatre, and I am an IT undergraduate. I am passionate about data visualization and analysis and am actively looking for opportunities where I can use my skills in a meaningful way. 
        I also enjoy web development and have undertaken projects for the same. My passion for learning goes beyond computer science as well, and I am deeply passionate about cosmology, quantum mechanics, and astrophysics.
        I am a fast learner and very much enjoy working on projects and self-studying. I have listed my projectsâ€”ones I've done as part of university coursework as well as personal projects. Have a look!
